# File Management Application
A file management application developed for NPOs. This application allows their employees to have a place where they can upload files, along with a name, description and tags.

This application was built to enable employees of NPOs from Tubingen, Germany to have one place where they could upload and store any documents that they need. The files can be
uploaded along with a name, description and tags. The tags are used to sort the files by relevancy or by type (Invoice, Contract etc.). The application also automatically converts the files on upload to PDF/A which is a ISO-standardized version of PDF used for archiving and long-term preservation of electronic documents. For this, the ConvertAPI API was
used.

The application is built using Django and SQLite. No front-end framework was used as the time frame given by the client was too short.
